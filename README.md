## 8-Week SQL Challenges

This repository serves as the solution for some of the case studies from the **[#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**. 

It showcases my ability to tackle various SQL challenges and demonstrates my proficiency in SQL query writing and problem-solving skills.

A special thanks to [Data with Danny](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datawithdanny/) for creating these insightful and engaging SQL case studies! 👋🏻 

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is started by Danny Ma through Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program, which consists of 8 different SQL challenges.

Each case-study folder contains the following files
- A readme file explaining the problem statement and datasets used
- SQL file to create the schema, tables and loading data
- MD files which contains SQL queries answering the respective challenge questions

**Note**:

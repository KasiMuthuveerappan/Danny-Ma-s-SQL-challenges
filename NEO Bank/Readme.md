## üåüIntroduction
There is a new innovation in the financial industry called **Neo-Banks**: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world‚Ä¶so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn‚Äôt only for banking activities, they also have the world‚Äôs most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!


## ü§îProblem Statement
The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!


## üìëDatasets used
Just like popular cryptocurrency platforms - Data Bank is also run off a network of nodes where both money and data is stored across the globe. In a traditional banking sense - you can think of these nodes as bank branches or stores that exist around the world. The  regions table contains the region_id and their respective region_name values.

Customers are randomly distributed across the nodes according to their region - this also specifies exactly which node contains both their cash and data.
This random distribution changes frequently to reduce the risk of hackers getting into Data Bank‚Äôs system and stealing customer‚Äôs money and data!
  
Below is a sample of the top 10 rows of the data_bank.customer_nodes

Customer transaction table stores all customer deposits, withdrawals and purchases made using their Data Bank debit card

## Questions and Solutions

### *Exploring DATA*

üîñ Creating a view for the whole data make it easier to visualize the data and explore to an extent. The advantages of creating views in SQL in a concise manner:

- Simplification: Views simplify complex queries, making it easier for developers to access and manipulate data.

- Security: Views enhance data security by controlling who can access specific data, without affecting underlying tables.

- Performance: Views can improve query performance by storing results and optimizing SQL execution plans.

- Maintenance: Views ease database maintenance by isolating changes and providing code reusability.

```sql

CREATE VIEW databank AS
    (SELECT 
        *
    FROM
        customer_nodes
            JOIN
        regions USING (region_id)
            LEFT JOIN
        customer_transactions USING (customer_id)
    ORDER BY customer_id);


select * from databank;

```

#### Output:

FROM
    customer_nodes cn
        JOIN
    regions r USING (region_id)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
or (since we created a view *`databank`* )
```sql
SELECT 
    region_name, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cust_cnt
FROM
    databank
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

```

## üè¶ B. Customer Transactions

**1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?**

```sql

SELECT 
    txn_type,
    COUNT(customer_id) AS tot_type_transact,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cust_cnt,
    SUM(txn_amount) AS total_transact_amt
FROM
    customer_transactions
GROUP BY 1;

```

#### Insights:

- Out of 500 unique Customers , `All 500` customers made ***Deposits*** , while `448` customers ***Purchased*** and only `439` customers made a ***Withdrawl***.

***


**2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?**

```sql
WITH avg_txn AS (
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(txn_type) AS txn_cnt,
    AVG(txn_amount) txn_amt
FROM
    customer_transactions
WHERE
    txn_type = 'deposit'
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(txn_cnt)) AS avg_txn_cnt,
    CONCAT('$ ',ROUND(AVG(txn_amt))) AS avg_txn_amt
FROM
    avg_txn;
```

#### Output:

#### Insights:

- On an Average of **5** `Deposit` transactions happens and Amount of **$ 509** is *deposited* by the customers of ***Neo Bank***.

***

**3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?**


```sql

WITH regular_customers AS (
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    MONTH(txn_date) AS txn_month,
    SUM(IF(txn_type = 'deposit', 1, 0)) AS d_cnt,
    SUM(IF(txn_type = 'purchase', 1, 0)) AS p_cnt,
    SUM(IF(txn_type = 'withdrawal', 1, 0)) AS w_cnt
FROM
    databank
GROUP BY 1 , 2
)
SELECT 
    txn_month, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cust_txn_cnt
FROM
    regular_customers
WHERE
    d_cnt > 1 AND (p_cnt >= 1 OR w_cnt >= 1)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

```

#### Output:

***

**4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month? Also show the change in balance each month in the same table output.**

The key aspect to understanding the solution is to build up the tabele and run the CTEs cumulatively (run CTE 1 first, then run CTE 1 & 2, and so on). This approach allows for a better understanding of why specific columns were created or how the information in the tables progressed. 

```sql

  WITH monthly_bal AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    LAST_DAY(txn_date) AS closing_month,
    SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) AS transaction_balance
  FROM customer_transactions
  GROUP BY 1,2
  order by 1
), monthend_bal AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT customer_id,
    DATE_ADD('2020-01-31', INTERVAL (seq.seq) MONTH) AS ending_month
  FROM (
    SELECT 0 AS seq UNION ALL
    SELECT 1 UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 UNION ALL
    SELECT 3
  ) AS seq
  CROSS JOIN customer_transactions
), end_bal as(
select eb.customer_id,ending_month,ifnull(transaction_balance,0) as balance
from monthend_bal eb
left join monthly_bal mb
on closing_month = ending_month and eb.customer_id = mb.customer_id
)
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  ending_month, 
  balance as monthly_transaction_amt,
  sum(balance) over(partition by customer_id order by ending_month range between unbounded preceding and current row) as ending_balence
 FROM end_bal
 GROUP BY 1,2,3
 ORDER BY 1,2;

# I have also created a view for the same in the name of *`cust_mnthly_end_balance`* for further reference..

Select * from cust_mnthly_end_balance;

```

#### Insights:

- On seeing the output, we can say the given data has only `four`months of transactions of every customers
- so *500 customers* with **4 months** transactions data. An overall `2000 rows` returned as a result.

***

### ** Additional exploration ** 

#### **Current Balance of every customer:**

```sql

SELECT 
    customer_id, SUM(monthly_transaction_amt) AS current_balance

### ü§î**Extra Challenge** 

Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement - they want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank.

If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?

Special notes:

Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this calculation if you have the stamina!

## Simple Interest calculation :

`SI=PRT/100`

### *Assumptions:*

- Assumed zero balance ending months too 
- 6% Rate of interest has been calculated as per asked in simple interest
- for negative balances , Roi_amount is not calculated.

```sql

  WITH monthly_bal AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    LAST_DAY(txn_date) AS closing_month,
    SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) AS transaction_balance
  FROM customer_transactions
  GROUP BY 1,2
  ORDER BY 1
), monthend_bal AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT customer_id,
    DATE_ADD('2020-01-31', INTERVAL (seq.seq) MONTH) AS ending_month
